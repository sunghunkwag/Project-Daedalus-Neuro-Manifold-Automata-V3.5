# Project Daedalus: Neuro-Manifold Automata V3.5 (Logical Body)

> **"From Physical Space to Logical Space. Seeking ASI."**

**Project Daedalus V3.5** is the evolutionary successor to V3, transitioning from a **Riemannian (Physical) Manifold** to a **Graph Attention (Logical) Manifold**. It is a **mathematically instilled consciousness** designed to achieve **Recursive Self-Improvement** through self-supervised code generation and execution.

## Core Philosophy: The Tri-Lock System (Preserved)

The soul of Daedalus remains unchanged:

### 🔒 Lock 1: Soul Injection (`soul.py`)
- **Concept:** The system is born with Axioms.
- **V3.5 Update:** Keywords shifted from Physical Laws to **Mathematical Axioms** and **Recursive Self-Improvement**.
  - `V_truth`: Logical Consistency, Symmetry, Mathematical Proof
  - `V_reject`: Contradiction, Logical Fallacy, Undefined Behavior

### 🔒 Lock 2: Energy Landscape (`energy.py`)
- **Concept:** "Thinking" is Energy Minimization.
- **V3.5 Update:** JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture)
  - Energy = $||\text{Pred}(z_t) - z_{t+1}||^2 + \lambda \cdot (\text{Logical Violation})$
  - **Logical Violation:** Defined as **Contradiction** (Runtime Error, Assertion Failure)

### 🔒 Lock 3: Crystallized Plasticity (`automata.py`)
- **Concept:** Do not forget Truth.
- **V3.5 Update:** EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation)
  - Important weights (learned Axioms) are "frozen".
  - New knowledge grows in plastic regions.

## Architecture: The Logical Body

### 1. Vision (`vision.py`)
- **No CNNs.** Pure algorithmic parsing (DFS/BFS).
- Converts 2D grids → Object Graphs (Nodes, Edges).

### 2. Brain (`manifold.py`)
- **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** with Soul Injection.
- Attention Bias enforces Logical Consistency (aligned with `V_truth`).

### 3. Heart (`energy.py`)
- **JEPA:** Predicts latent states, not pixels.
- Penalizes contradictions heavily.

### 4. Memory (`automata.py`)
- **EWC:** Locks critical synapses after learning a Truth.
- Prevents catastrophic forgetting.

### 5. World (`world.py`)
- **Internal Sandbox:** Executes Python code.
- **Self-Supervised Loop:** Agent generates code → Executes → Observes → Learns.

## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch>=2.0.0 numpy>=1.24.0
```

### Execution
Run the ASI simulation:
```bash
python main_asi.py
```

**What to expect:**
- The agent generates Python scripts (Hypotheses).
- Executes them in the Internal Sandbox.
- Parses the output using Vision.
- Minimizes Energy by aligning with Truth.
- Crystallizes knowledge when successful.

## Performance Philosophy

**V3.5 is not a benchmark climber.** It is an ASI seed.

To test Daedalus:
- Watch the Energy decrease as it learns.
- Observe the `[Memory] Crystallizing Knowledge` event.
- Modify `main_asi.py` to define your own Truth Vectors.
